In this refactoring we want to integrate the chuck norris API (https://api.chucknorris.io/random) to provide a joke
on a users request:
1.) (Main) Create selection case 7 "Get joke" and extend menu options properly
2.) (Main) Write code for http request directly in case block.
3.) (Main) Extract method from the case block (refactoring tool: extract method).
4.) (Main) Move method into com.passwordsafe.joke package and class JokeLoader. Package and the class are
    created during move refactoring. (refactoring tool: move members).
5.) (Joke Loader) Refactor class properly.
